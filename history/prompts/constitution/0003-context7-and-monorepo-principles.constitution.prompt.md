## Prompt

perfect we need to update few things like. use context7 for documentation gethering and also as mentioned monorepo please add these two into the constitution

## Response snapshot

- Added constitution principles: Context7-first documentation gathering and monorepo organization rules.
- Synced plan template constitution gates to include these checks.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Constitution now mandates Context7 for docs gathering and enforces monorepo boundaries.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (docs/templates only)
- 📁 Files: Updated constitution + plan template
- 🔁 Next prompts: Start rewriting Phase specs under `specs/` and proceed `/sp.plan` → `/sp.tasks` per feature.
- 🧠 Reflection: Hardening governance prevents drift and reduces doc-related errors.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: N/A
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Add a “Docs links” section to each spec that lists the Context7 library IDs used.
