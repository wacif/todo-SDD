# Contracts for Feature 003: Professional Landing Page

**Status**: Not Applicable (N/A)

This feature is a static, read-only frontend application component. It relies entirely on the existing authentication system (Better Auth) for user state detection but does not introduce any new server-side API endpoints, REST contracts, or data-mutating operations.

All data and content are defined as client-side TypeScript interfaces and constants in `data-model.md`.
